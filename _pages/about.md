Shyam Deo is a postdoctoral research staff at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). His current research is focused on various aspects of sustainable energy conversions (H2 generation from liquid organic hydrogen carriers), carbon capture, and associated techno-economic analysis (TEA). He has six years of research experience on building rationales for catalyst design at atomic scales through ab-initio and statistical methods guided by experiments as well as physical and machine learning (ML)-based insights. He underwent two years of postdoctoral training under Dr. Frank Abild-Pedersen at Stanford University’s SUNCAT Center for Interface Science and Catalysis. He completed his Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering (with a computational materials minor) at Pennsylvania State University under the guidance of Dr. Michael Janik in 2021. His dissertation is titled ‘Tuning metal-support interactions for catalysis at multi-component interfaces using ab - initio and statistical methods guided by experiments’. He completed his B.Tech. with honors in chemical engineering from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-BHU, India in 2013 where he was awarded IIT-(BHU) Varanasi Gold Medal along with several other accolades for his outstanding academic achievements at the departmental level. Before joining graduate school, he worked as a production engineer, heading a workforce team in a Catalytic Reforming Unit at Indian Oil Corporation Limited, Digboi refinery in India for three years (2013-2016). His research interests align towards accelerating materials discovery through a wide range of computational methods. He aims to combine physics-based models, high-throughput simulations, ab initio simulation methods like density functional theory (DFT), and machine learning (ML) for exploration of functional materials, catalyst design in thermal and electrocatalytic reactions, and the development of energy storage materials.
